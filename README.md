```pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib```

* Install Jupyter (ex- IPython Notebook)
* Run it
* Open VKAuth.ipynb
* Run it
* VK auth token will be saved to `datasets/token`. After that you will be able to run notebooks for fetching data and analysis

## Notebooks

* *GetData.ipynb* — fetches data from VK
* *Groups analysis.ipynb* — analyzes groups and creates nice looking plots
* *Interests analysis.ipynb* — does the same thing with interests

We pushed our datasets to datasets folder

## Images

As a result you will see plots in `images` dir. We use these plots on our website.
